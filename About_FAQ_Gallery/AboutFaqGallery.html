<h1>About</h1>
<section class="story">
  <h2><span>Logout</span> story</h2>
  <p>LOGOUT is the largest conference of Information technology, computer science technology,
     gaming etc. within Lithuania. It’s a 2 day conference which involves
     newest trends in development and technology. Last year it involved 2,000 professionals,
     enthusiasts and stakeholders engaging in workshops, discussing
     relevant issues, networking, giving out awards and providing Vilnius with
     a solid party. We are proud to be able to welcome you all again this year as previous success
     and unexpected involvement of people last year encouraged us to try even harder to showcase
     newest trends and involve as many new enthusiasts as possible.</p>
  <p>LOGOUT began in the year or 2017 and it gained success straight away. Therefore this
      year it is expected to attract at least 4,000 people with interest, curiousity and
      innovative mindsets to participate and bring their ideas into workshops, meet people,
      update their knowledge and just have fun in general. This year we put extra effort and
      expanded our team to be able to organize a bigger and better conference. Also this year
      the event will be held in Forum palace in estimation of bigger audience. We expect YOU
      to make LOGOUT an annual tradition, a deep technology hub, a festival for the whole country. </p>
  <p>Out main values at LOGOUT which we go by are ENGAGE x EMPOWER x CONNECT x EMBRACE,
      as we believe that the event is not created only by organisers but also by participants themselves
      and we expect active participation from everyone. We strive for innovation where creative marketing
      brings mathematical algorithms to the market, where personal stories become trailblazing business
      strategies and where there’s always room for some craziness. Please remember: YOU are part of the
      event and you are partly responsible for the future of LOGOUT(no pressure). We encourage enthusiasts
      to join and be a part of this awesome and unforgetable experience.</p>
